### Problems Solved:
- 9/1/2019: Given a string of words delimited by spaces,
reverse the words in string. For example,
given "hello world here", return "here world hello"

- 9/2/2019: Given a string and a set of delimiters,
reverse the words in the string while
maintaining the relative order of the
delimiters.

- 9/4/2019: Generate a finite, but an arbitrarily large binary
tree quickly in O(1).

- 9/6/2019: Given a sorted list of integers,
  square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

- 9/7/2019: Given a set of closed intervals,
  find the smallest set of numbers that covers
  all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest
  sets, return any of them.

- 9/9/2019: Given a string which we can delete at most k,
  return whether you can make a palindrome.

- 9/12/2019: Write a function that, given n, returns the number of rounds
  you'd expect to play until one coin remains.

- 9/13/2019: Given the root of a binary search tree, and a target K,
          return two nodes in the tree whose sum equals K.

- 9/14/2019:  Write a function that rotates a list by k elements.
          For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes
          [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. Try solving this without creating
          a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations
          do you need?

- 9/15/2019: Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in
  the same linked list format.

- 9/16/2019: Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary
  to complete the Tower of Hanoi. You should assume that
  the rods are numbered, with the first rod being 1, the
  second (auxiliary) rod being 2, and the last (goal) rod being 3.

- 9/18/2019: Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a
  company in chronological order and an integer k, return the maximum
  profit you can make from k buys and sells.

- 9/22/2019: Use a more space-efficient data structure, SparseArray, that
  implements the same interface:

  init(arr, size): initialize with the original large array and size.
  set(i, val): updates index at i with val.
  get(i): gets the value at index i.
