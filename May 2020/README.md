### My solutions for April DCP 2020 starting on 5-1-2020

- 5-1-2020: Implement a queue using a set of fixed-length arrays. The queue should support enqueue, dequeue, and get_size operations.

- 5-5-2020: Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies
everyone's priorities.

- 5-7-2020: Create a program that finds all strobogrammatic numbers with N digits.

- 5-10-2020: Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is O(1).

- 5-14-2020: You’re tracking stock price at a given instance of time. Implement an API
with the following functions: add(), update(), remove(), which adds/updates/removes a
datapoint for the stock price you are tracking. The data is given as (timestamp, price),
where timestamp is specified in unix epoch time. Also, provide max(), min(), and average() functions that give the max/min/average of all
values seen thus far.
