@details Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines
whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
2. All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) or terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
3. There must be a single space between each word.
4. The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.

### TESTS
print(sentence_check("This is a sentence.")) # True
print(sentence_check("This  is not a sentence.")) # False
print(sentence_check("Th:is is a sentence.")) # True
print(sentence_check("This is a not sentence. ")) # False
print(sentence_check("This is a not 1sentence.")) # False
