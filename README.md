# Problems Solved:
- 8/4/19: Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b,
return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0,
using only mathematical or bit operations.
You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

- 8/5/19: Given a string of parentheses,
write a function to compute the minimum number
of parentheses to be removed to make the
string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is
eventually closed).

- 8/6/19: Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate.

- 8/7/19: Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication,
or modulus operators. Return the quotient
as an integer, ignoring the remainder.

- 8/8/19: Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

- 8/9/19: Given an integer n and a list of integers l,
write a function that randomly generates a
number from 0 to n-1 that isn't in l (uniform).

- 8/10/19: What does the below code snippet print out?
How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())

- 8/11/19: We're given a hashmap associating each
courseId key with a list of courseIds values,
which represents that the prerequisites of
courseId are courseIds. Return a sorted
ordering of courses such that we can finish
all courses.

Return null if there is no such ordering.
