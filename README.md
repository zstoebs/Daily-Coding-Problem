# Problems Solved:
- 8/4/19: Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b,
return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0,
using only mathematical or bit operations.
You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

- 8/5/19: Given a string of parentheses,
write a function to compute the minimum number
of parentheses to be removed to make the
string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is
eventually closed).

- 8/6/19: Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate.

- 8/7/19: Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication,
or modulus operators. Return the quotient
as an integer, ignoring the remainder.

- 8/8/19: Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

- 8/9/19: Given an integer n and a list of integers l,
write a function that randomly generates a
number from 0 to n-1 that isn't in l (uniform).

- 8/10/19: What does the below code snippet print out?
How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?

functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())

- 8/11/19: We're given a hashmap associating each
courseId key with a list of courseIds values,
which represents that the prerequisites of
courseId are courseIds. Return a sorted
ordering of courses such that we can finish
all courses.
Return null if there is no such ordering.

- 8/12/19: Given a tree, find the largest tree/subtree that is a BST.
Given a tree, return the size of the largest tree/subtree that is a BST.

- 8/13/19: Given a binary tree of integers,
find the maximum path sum between two nodes.
The path must go through at least one node,
and does not need to go through the root.

- 8/14/19: Given a number represented by a list of digits,
find the next greater permutation of a number,
in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there
is not greater permutation possible, return
the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.

- 8/15/19: Given a number in the form of a list of digits,
return all possible permutations.

- 8/16/19: Write a map implementation with a get function
that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

- 8/17/19: Given a 2D board of characters and a word,
find if the word exists in the grid.

- 8/18/19: Given an unsorted array of integers,
find the length of the longest consecutive
elements sequence.

- 8/19/19: You are given a sequence of points and
the order in which you need to cover the
points. Give the minimum number of steps
in which you can achieve it.

- 8/20/19: Given an even number (greater than 2),
return two prime numbers whose sum will
be equal to the given number.

- 8/21/19: Given a list of integers and a number K,
return which contiguous elements of the
list sum to K.

- 8/22/19: Given a string and a set of characters,
return the shortest substring containing
all the characters in the set.

- 8/23/19: Determine whether a doubly linked
list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly linked?

- 8/24/19: Given a function f, and N return a
debounced f of N milliseconds.

- 8/25/19: Given an integer list where each number
represents the number of hops you can make,
determine whether you can reach to the last
index starting at index 0.

- 8/26/19: Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise.

- 8/27/19: Given two strings A and B, return whether
or not A can be shifted some number of
times to get B.
