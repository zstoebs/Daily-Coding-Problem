# Daily Coding Problem
### My solutions to the DCP email distro!

I started regularly solving these problems on 8-4-2019 as inspo to practice programming daily.

Most of my solutions are in Python for readability, although occasionally I'll solve them in C++. If I attempt the problem, I give it a best-attempt and sometimes it doesn't work. Occasionally, I'll seek help online and when I do I'll cite the URL in the file.

**Disclaimer**: I often include the DCP admin solution released the following day. I do not own or use the DCP admin solutions and they are included only for comparison with my solution. If included, the admin solution is denoted (typically with `### ADMIN SOLUTION`) to not be confused with my material.

This repo is publicly available and you can use it how you see fit.
