# Daily Coding Problem
My solutions to the DCP email distro!

I started regularly solving these problems on 8-4-2019 as inspiration to practice programming daily.

Most of my solutions are in Python for readability, although occasionally I'll solve them in C++. If I attempt the problem, I give it a best-attempt and sometimes it doesn't work. Occasionally, I'll seek help online and when I do I'll cite the URL in the file. 

This repo is publicly available and you can use it how you see fit.
