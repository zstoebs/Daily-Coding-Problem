# Problems Solved:
- 8/4/19 : Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, 
return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, 
using only mathematical or bit operations. 
You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

- 8/5/19 : Given a string of parentheses, 
write a function to compute the minimum number 
of parentheses to be removed to make the 
string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is 
eventually closed).

- 8/6/19: Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate.
