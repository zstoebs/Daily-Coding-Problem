### Problems Solved:
- 10/3/2019: Given the head of a singly linked list, swap every two nodes and return its head. (I tried doing this in C++ b/c it would be too easy in Python but alas it didn't work well.)

- 10/7/2019: Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j)
which returns the sum from the sublist L[i:j] (including i, excluding j).

- 10/8/2019: Given a list of points, a central point, and an integer k,
find the nearest k points from the central point.
